# Github Viewer React App

Create a react js app based on a egghead.io tutorial.  I added some extra logic and used semantic-ui as the UI Style CSS kit rather than Boostrap.

This app can search for a GitHub user and bring down there information using the GitHub API.

You can take notes about the GitHub user and store them on the firebase.io cloud db.
